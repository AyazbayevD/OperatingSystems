To increase hit/miss ratio, we should increase number of page frames or make page reference numbers less different from each other.
Example:
amount of page frames : 1000
page reference numbers: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ... 1

To decrease hit/miss ratio, we should decrease number of page frames or make page reference numbers as much different from each other as we can.
Example:
amount of page frames: 1
page reference numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 100, 101, ...
